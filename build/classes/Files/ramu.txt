Ramu is a village in Ramu Upazila of Cox’s Bazar district, Bangladesh. You’d find quite a few buddhist temple around that area. Amongst those the Rangkut Bonasram Buddha Bihar is the most famous and visited one. This buddhist temple is just around 14-20 kilometers from the main town of Cox’s Bazar. If you have a plan to spend more than couple of days in Cox’s Bazar then this place is nice one to explore. This place is not that much huge and do not expect too much to see from there.

Ramu buddhist temple was established at around the year 338 BC. The temple premise has several statues of the Gautama Buddha inside the temple. They are in different colors and shapes. I found the white one was most impressive. Everyday lot of people use to visit the temple for religious purpose. Sometimes few visitors use to enjoy the beauty and natural quietness from here too.

My reason to go there was as I read about Ramu in our textbook when I was doing my primary education. Can’t remember exactly which grade I was that time. It was kind of full filing the childhood dream place to see. The entrance of the temple was having a very artistic golden gate that has an Asian style. You could see the stuffed art work of Buddha itself (also a dragon) on that facade. We didn’t need any entry fee that time (or may be, I forgot). Probably these days they charge a little for the entry.
